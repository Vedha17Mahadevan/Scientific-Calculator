# Scientific Calculator using Python

## Overview
This repository contains a **basic Scientific Calculator** developed using **Python** as part of our **Semester 2 academic project** for the **Python Programming course**.

The project was created to understand and apply **core Python concepts**, **mathematical computations**, and **GUI development using Tkinter**.  
It includes both:
- A **command-line (terminal-based) calculator**
- A **GUI-based scientific calculator using Tkinter**

This project is **educational in nature** and intended for learning and academic evaluation.

## 🎯 Purpose of the Project
The primary objectives of this project were to:
- Strengthen Python programming fundamentals
- Implement arithmetic and scientific calculations
- Learn GUI development using Tkinter
- Understand event handling and function-based logic
- Gain experience working in a small team

---

## ⚙️ Features
- Basic arithmetic operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division
- Scientific operations: Square root, Power, Trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan), Logarithmic calculations
- Two modes of execution: **Console-based calculator** & **GUI-based calculator using Tkinter**

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python 3**
- **Tkinter** (for GUI development)
- **Math module** (for scientific calculations)
